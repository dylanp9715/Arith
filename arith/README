We received help from various TAs.

Everything should be implemented correctly.

We first determine from user input whether to call compress40 or decompress40,
both of which are in our compress40.c file. If they called compress40, we run 
the compress40 function which will read in the ppm and perform the calculations
necessary to convert the pixels from rgb values to video color and pack the 
blocks of a uarray2b that we create. The first set of calculations is done in 
our rgb_vid_conversion file while the second set is performed in our 
pack_or_unpack file. If the user called decompress40, we will run the 
decompress40 function which will read in the code words with functions in 
process_compressed and then perform the calculations necessary to unpack the 
code words and convert from vid_color values to rgb values. These first 
calculations are performed in pack_or_unpack and the second set is in 
rgb_vid_conversion.
